    <p class="lead">
      This is a simple todo list app made by me to have hands-on practice of
      working in Angular & Node.js/Express.js with PostgreSQL database in
      backend.
    </p>
    <hr class="my-4" />
    <p>
      It uses features such as Routing, Services, Animations, Making HTTP
      Requests, Observables. The Express.js backend uses PostgreSQL database to
      store information through the use of REST APIs. You can add, delete or
      update an exisitng todo by using these APIs.
